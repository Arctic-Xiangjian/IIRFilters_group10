# ECE6530 Final Project: IIR Filter Practice and PeZ GUI Usage

This repository contains the final project materials for **ECE6530**, focusing on the implementation of **IIR Filters** and the use of the **PeZ GUI**. The project includes two main parts: Lab Exercises and a Mini-Project, both of which demonstrate the practical application of IIR filters in signal processing.

## Project Structure

### 1. `LabP16_Exercise4567`
This folder contains all materials related to the Lab Exercises required by the project. It includes:

- **Screenshots** and **video demonstrations** of dynamic operations performed in the exercises.
- A MATLAB script, `main.m`, which:
  - Automatically generates the required code to verify Lab Exercise tasks.
  - Contains **answers** and **reflections** for the exercise questions embedded as comments in the script.
  - **Showcases three key frames** from the video demonstrations. Due to challenges in embedding videos direct

### 2. `Mini-Project_02_PeZ`
This folder demonstrates a simple implementation of **audio filtering** by comparing the performance of different filters on the audio file `SunshineSquare.wav`. Key highlights include:

- Running the `main.m` script in this folder:
  - Generates all **filtered audio outputs** as `.wav` files.
  - Allows for easy adjustment of **filter orders** for FIR and IIR filters to explore their effects.
  - Provides insights into the efficient design of **notch filters** for suppressing unwanted frequencies.


#### `untitled.m`
This script is a utility for converting `.wav` files to `.mp3` format to ensure **maximum compatibility** across different devices and applications.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired folder (`LabP16_Exercise4567` or `Mini-Project_02_PeZ`).
3. Run the corresponding `main.m` script in MATLAB:
   - For Lab Exercises, this generates results and includes annotated answers.
   - For the Mini-Project, this generates filtered audio outputs.
4. Use `untitled.m` to convert `.wav` files to `.mp3` format if needed.
